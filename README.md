Raspberry Pi Color Detection Project
This project uses the Raspberry Pi and the Picamera2 module to detect colors in images captured by the camera.

Prerequisites
Raspberry Pi with Picamera2 module
Python 3
OpenCV library
Setup
Install the required libraries by running the following commands:
Edit
Full Screen
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-picamera2 python3-opencv
Clone the project repository:
Edit
Full Screen
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/color-detection.git
Usage
Navigate to the project directory:
Edit
Full Screen
Copy code
cd color-detection
Run the color detection script:

Copy code
python3 color_detection.py
Code
Here is the code for the color detection script:

python

import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load the camera
camera = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

# Define the color range for blue (BGR)
lower_blue = np.array([110, 50, 50])
upper_blue = np.array([130, 255, 255])

while True:
    # Capture a frame from the camera
    ret, frame = camera.read()

    # Convert the frame to HSV color space
    hsv = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)

    # Apply the color range filter to the HSV frame
    mask = cv2.inRange(hsv, lower_blue, upper_blue)

    # Bitwise-AND the mask with the original frame to get the blue objects
    blue_objects = cv2.bitwise_and(frame, frame, mask=mask)

    # Display the original frame, the mask, and the blue objects
    cv2.imshow('Original Frame', frame)
    cv2.imshow('Mask', mask)
    cv2.imshow('Blue Objects', blue_objects)

    # Exit the loop if the 'q' key is pressed
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# Release the camera and close the windows
camera.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
This code captures frames from the camera, converts them to HSV color space, applies a color range filter to detect blue objects, and displays the original frame, the mask, and the detected blue objects.

You can modify the lower_blue and upper_blue variables to detect different colors.

This is a basic writeup for a Raspberry Pi project that uses the Picamera2 module to detect colors in images. You can modify the code to detect different colors or improve the color detection algorithm.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
